# Overview

Implement the following containers:

• vector

• map

• stack

Take the structure of each container as reference. You have to comply with the C++98 standard.

# Mandatory part

• If the container has an iterator system, you must implement it.

• You must produce two binaries that run the same tests: one with your containers only, and the other one with the STL containers.

• Compare outputs and performance / timing (your containers can be up to 20
times slower).
